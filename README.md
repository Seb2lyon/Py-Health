# Py-Health

This project is a Python GUI (in French) that will calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) in order to help you to evaluate your health condition.

You can create an account (saved only on your local computer) in order to check periodically the evolution of your BMI.

This app is able to calculate the BMI of every people aged from 1 year old.

I'm still on the way of developping it... so don't hesitate to give me advices or help me to improve the scripts.

Be safe :-)
